### What's a JRA? ###

The Juvenile Risk Assessment (JRA) is a set of two surveys used to evaluate juvenile offenders and their risk for re-offending. The original (paper) surveys were created and refined as part of a project by the Washington State Institute of Public Policy and placed in the public domain. A private research and evaluation group in Colorado, the TriWest Group created a revised version of the JRA called the CJRA (yes, C = Colorado). TriWest Group has made a web-based version of the CJRA available to their clients for a number of years, but is interested in getting out of the business. This project is an effort to make an open source implementation of the JRA that social service and juvenile justice organizations can use. Ideally, this will make this tool available to a much wider set of organizations and, thanks to the open source pricing model, affordable to chronically underfunded juvenile justice organizations.
